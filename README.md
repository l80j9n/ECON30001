ECON30001 Problem   Set   2 
Semester   1 2024Question 1. Consider   the   following   competitive   labour   market.   There   are   many   identical ﬁrms   that   can   hire   workers.   Each ﬁrm   produces   the   same   output   using   a   constant   returns   to scale   technology   and   the   price   of   output   is   set   to   one.   The   market   determines   a   wage   level w for   labour.   Let θ denote   the   number   of   units   of   output   (equal   to   revenue)   that   a   worker can   produce.    There   is   asymmetric   information.    Worker productivity   levels   are   privately   known,   and   are   uniformly   distributed   between   24,000   and   40,000.      Let r(θ)   denote   the reservation   wage   of   an   employee   with   productivity θ .
(a) Explain   fully   what   is   meant   by   a   competitive   equilibrium   in   this   market.
(b) Suppose   that r(θ)   =   0:9θ .
(i) Derive   and   graphically illustrate the   ﬁrm’s conditional   expected revenue   as   a   function   of the market wage, conditioning on available labour choosing to accept employment.
(ii) Find   the   competitive   equilibrium   and   calculate   the   percentage   of the   population   that   will be unemployed.
(c) Suppose that r(θ)   =   0:75θ .
(i) Derive   and   graphically illustrate the   ﬁrm’s conditional   expected revenue   as   a   function   of the market wage, conditioning on available labour choosing to accept employment.

Question 2. Consider   the   following   competitive   market   for   insurance.There are two states of   the world:   good G and bad B.   Consumers have wealth 20, but if   the bad   state   occurs   their   wealth   is   10.   Consumers   are   risk   averse, expected   utility   maximisers,   with   common utility   function u(x)   =   ln(x).    There   are two types   of consumers:    high risk   types H and   low   risk   types L .   The   probabilities   that H and L types ﬁnd   themselves   in   the bad   state   are pH =   0.5 and pL = 0.4.   There   is   probability β =   0.6 that   a   consumer   picked at random is   type L.
Firms   are   risk-neutral   expected   proﬁt   maximisers.       The   ﬁrm   oﬀers   consumers   a   state-   contingent contracts c =   (cG, cB) in exchange for their   endowment e =   (eG, eB).
(a) Explain   what   is   meant   by   a   competitive   equilibrium   of   this   market.
(b) Explain   and   derive   the   equilibrium   insurance   contracts   under   the   assumption   that   there   is perfect information.
(c) Explain   and   derive   the   equilibrium   insurance   contracts   under   the   assumption   that   there   is void information.
(d) Explain   and   derive   the   equilibrium   insurance   contracts   under   the   assumption   that   there   is asymmetric information, and assuming that equilibrium exists.
